          <h1>1st Learn typing</h1>
          <p class="para3">Practice regularly and your fingers will learn their location on the keyboard through muscle memory.It takes less than 10 hours to learn to type with 10 fingers at about 15 words per minute and another 5 hours to reach hand writing speed of about 20 WPM. The best way is to learn over a short period of time. A lesson a day over 10 days and a further 5 days of practice-typing is recommended.

          <p>It's true that you can learn programming languages on your own, but it won't be easy. Coding is a highly technical job that entails different algorithms and complex data structures. On the flip side, learning by yourself allows you to set the pace of your education.
